       " <br><br> Vice Chancellor , Marias Gamesa , Ludhiana , India <br><br> The Subject :   Pandemic of COVID-19 <br><br> The novel corona virus and the Covid-19 disease it causes , have become the <br><br> gravest public - health threat across the   globe , and on March 11 , 2020    the WHO <br><br> declared it as a pandemic . Like in other nations , it has put pan India on the super alert <br><br> mode . Almost all organizations and departments , public or private , are now working <br><br> from home . <br><br> As a preventive measure and to ensure social distancing , faculty , staff and <br><br> students have   been given a   break till   further orders under the instructions of the <br><br> Government , Higher Education Department and UGC . The lockdown is likely to be <br><br> extended further . <br><br> The Marias Gamesa is fully concerned that the endangered pandemic situation <br><br> which is beyond control should not cause academic loss of students . It has discontinued <br><br> classroom   instruction   and   moved   classes   online   as   one   of   the   ways   to   help <br><br> students continue their studies when the university is closed . <br><br> The Challenge for Knowledge Transfer Regarding COVID-19 <br><br> Knowledge flow and knowledge transfer are strategically vital to organizations for <br><br> several reasons .   For a deadly healthcare problem like COVID-19 , the knowledge flow <br><br> should be accurate , timely and continuous . The biggest challenge is to stop the spread <br><br> of the virus and take the needed precautions to stop its entering the community phase . <br><br> In view of this , the present   activity   was selected so that Marias Gamesa could <br><br> perform its intended duty of knowledge flow and transfer to its faculty , staff , students <br><br> and other stakeholders . As its Vice Chancellor , I deemed it proper to identify the task of <br><br> Story Telling to carry   out the activity effectively . <br><br> The Case Study of Story Telling <br><br> The story telling for knowledge transfer facilitates the better co - ordination of work <br><br> flow linking multiple sub - units and people . Furthermore , it can enable the organizations <br><br> to focus on emerging   opportunities requiring the collaboration of   related sub - units . The <br><br> present case study is therefore selected as : <br><br> “ Story telling as a tool for knowledge transfer to community : a case study of COVID-19 ” <br><br> Selection of the Tool Design <br><br> I have purposely selected Story Telling ( Module 2 ) for my task of spreading <br><br> awareness as to what precautions can be used to keep the virus at bay and how to stay <br><br> protected .   Since the prevention is better than cure and one has to focus on one ’s own <br><br> protection first , the story telling can help propagate the guidelines such as : <br><br>  Social distancing , <br><br>  Staying at home , <br><br>  Sanitizing the stuffs and hands using sanitizers or washing with soap and water <br><br>  Following a sequencing of activities involving surface contamination <br><br>  Observing all directives of the government , statuary bodies and the WHO , etc . <br><br> I consider the topic I chose for my case presentation can be better dealt with this <br><br> module of Story Telling . <br><br> 1 . I   took   story   telling   in   groups   of   students ,   faculty ,   parents   and   volunteers <br><br> ( mentors ) . The origin of virus , its contagiousness , spread and precautions were <br><br> told in vernacular terms <br><br> 2 . The   benefits   of using   sanitizers , washing   hands with   foaming   soaps for 20 <br><br> seconds   repeatedly ,   sharing   importance   of   cleaning   door   handles ,   valets , <br><br> keyrings , currency notes , shoes , etc . was highlighted in the story . <br><br> 3 . The feedback and personal experience of others were asked <br><br> 4 . Including the feedback in subsequent stories for other groups were useful <br><br> 5 . The story telling was undertaken in an interactive way <br><br> 6 . The story telling involved the listeners to be story tellers in their own way <br><br> 7 . The transfer of knowledge was made easy by including ideoms and proverbs <br><br> during the talk . <br><br> Description of My Reflection <br><br>  The challenge description of the case study   provides   description in adequate   details . <br><br>  The example   describes the selected tool including the needed information is a   useful way <br><br>  The description of tool has been given in adequate details . It indicates how the   activities were done . <br><br>  The    insight description of the case has been given . <br><br>  Since the case study is being taken up under a situation beyond control , the   alternative approach has not been suggested . <br><br>  The description given here is adequate and useful <br><br> The story telling is an effective tool to communicate the information about the <br><br> COVID-19 to the community and to disseminate the effective preventive measures . <br><br> Application of the Tool <br><br> The Marias Gamesa took an initiative of On - line Education . The free digital content <br><br> along with relevant links , resource material are made available to students without any <br><br> charges . The content is in conformity with the curriculum and has been devised to <br><br> impart chapter wise and topic wise learning and assessment . The online access is <br><br> available either on android mobile , phone , tablet , laptop or desk top .   The teachers have <br><br> prepared daily task format on Google sheets and the same is followed and monitored by <br><br> higher authorities on daily basis . <br><br> The   faculty   is   delivering   online   deliberations   in   interactive   mode   –   video <br><br> conferencing , and Skype . The subject matter notes , resource material , questionnaire , <br><br> etc . , are provided to students through the Google Class Rooms generated by the ERP <br><br> System of the University . The links of useful video clippings , webinars , simulators , ppts , <br><br> slide shows and recorded talks are being shared among students .   The students speak , <br><br> ask questions , and take part in the discussion with their teachers . <br><br> Not only for students , University has also taken a step forward by going Digital <br><br> and successfully implemented ERP solution in just a time span of four months with such <br><br> a   big   success to achieve   paperless university .   This module   is functional   for staff , <br><br> students , administration and various other sections . The students , who are still in the <br><br> hostels have been provided wireless internet hotspots facilitating them to use WiFi to <br><br> complete course work and log on classes . The ppts are loaded with voice over for topics <br><br> relevant to the courses . <br><br> Assignments topics are being shared with students on the assignment panel . <br><br> Students are made to work on these and submit completed assignments online by the <br><br> fixed time . The efforts are proving successful and daily progress is being monitored . <br><br> The Insight Gained <br><br> By implementing the initiative of online education using the ICT and IT provisions <br><br> several gains have been experienced . The major ones are : <br><br>  The administrative and gubernatorial departments working online can   help <br><br> students in case of need . <br><br>  The students can reap the benefit in terms of interacting with their teachers and <br><br> mentors . There is no loss of study even during the lockdown . The faculty can <br><br> ensure that their education is not affected in any way due to the ‘ lockdown ’ . The <br><br> university has made arrangement for appraisal of assignments , quizzes and <br><br> online tests have been made . <br><br>  The On - line education can be started in educational institution . Working from <br><br> home can be an acceptable system in educational and gubernatorial offices . It <br><br> leads to several benefits including : less pollution , cost - effective working , reduced <br><br> risk   of   travelling ,   less accidents ,   slowing   down   global   warming   due   to   less <br><br> pollution due to burning of fuels and hydrocarbons . <br><br>  The Marias Gamesa pleads its students , faculty and staff to observe all precautions <br><br> and stay protected against the spread of corona virus . <br><br> </div></span>"
